# sql-power-drills

PostgreSQL Fluency Trainer
This is my personal SQL training ground — organized around the Four Pillars of SQL:

- Query Fluency & Set Logic

- Readable & Robust SQL

- Scripted SQL & Automation

- Data Pipeline Thinking

I'm building fluency through daily drills: writing queries, designing schema setups, running everything through PostgreSQL and Bash.

Each drill lives in its own file. Every query is written, tested, and versioned. This repo prepares me for Turing-style interviews and real data engineering work.
