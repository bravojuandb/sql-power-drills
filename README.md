## Description of each Section

### [Pillar 1 — Query Fluency](pillar1_query_fluency/README.md)  
![SQLite](https://img.shields.io/badge/sqlite-%2307405e.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=sqlite&logoColor=white)  

I use the [Chinook database](https://github.com/lerocha/chinook-database) for all drills in this section, running on the [SQLite](https://sqlite.org/index.html) engine.  

###  Pillar 2 — Analytical SQL 
Use CTEs, subqueries, and window functions to answer business questions.  
Develop multi-step, layered logic for reports and metrics.

### Pillar 3 — Data Engineering SQL  
Design schemas, enforce constraints, clean raw data, deduplicate, and load tables.  
Build the warehouse structure that pipelines depend on.

### Pillar 4 — Performance & Indexing  
Understand how queries run.  
Use EXPLAIN plans and indexes to improve speed, reduce scans, and avoid common anti-patterns.

### Pillar 5 — Python ETL Automation  
Use Python to move, clean, and transform data.  
Write ETL scripts, connect to databases, manage configs, and validate inputs.

### Pillar 6 — Orchestration & Scheduling  
Run pipelines automatically and reliably.  
Build DAG-style workflows with dependencies, retries, idempotency, and logging.

### Pillar 7 — Cloud Data Fundamentals  
Store and move data in cloud environments.  
Use object storage, IAM basics, and warehouse loading patterns safely and efficiently.

### Pillar 8 — Full Pipeline Architecture  
Assemble complete systems:  
raw → staging → clean → analytics layers, with data quality checks, modular structure, and documentation.
