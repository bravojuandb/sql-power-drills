Καλλίστη ἁρμονίη 
            ἀφανὴς 
               φανερῆς ἀρείων.

The finest harmony 
            is the hidden, 
               better than the visible. – Heraclitus

This is my personal training ground for SQL language, organized around 8 pillars:

**[Pillar 1 — Query Fluency](pillar1_query_fluency/README.md)**  
Become fluent on the fundamentals of querying: selecting, filtering, grouping, joining, and handling NULLs. 

**Pillar 2 — Analytical SQL**  
Use CTEs, subqueries, and window functions to answer business questions.  
Develop multi-step, layered logic for reports and metrics.

**Pillar 3 — Data Engineering SQL**  
Design schemas, enforce constraints, clean raw data, deduplicate, and load tables.  
Build the warehouse structure that pipelines depend on.

**Pillar 4 — Performance & Indexing**  
Understand how queries run.  
Use EXPLAIN plans and indexes to improve speed, reduce scans, and avoid common anti-patterns.

**Pillar 5 — Python ETL Automation**  
Use Python to move, clean, and transform data.  
Write ETL scripts, connect to databases, manage configs, and validate inputs.

**Pillar 6 — Orchestration & Scheduling**  
Run pipelines automatically and reliably.  
Build DAG-style workflows with dependencies, retries, idempotency, and logging.

**Pillar 7 — Cloud Data Fundamentals**  
Store and move data in cloud environments.  
Use object storage, IAM basics, and warehouse loading patterns safely and efficiently.

**Pillar 8 — Full Pipeline Architecture**  
Assemble complete systems:  
raw → staging → clean → analytics layers, with data quality checks, modular structure, and documentation.
